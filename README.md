This project is a studying app for your iphone using react native
where you make your own quizzes for yourself.
To run the app, you will need to go to your iphones app store and install 'expo'.
Then download my files from this github, in
in your terminal type in 'npm install', and once its finished installing type 'npm start'.
Your computer will launch an expo screen, and you'll be able to see this app in your
expo app on your iphone.
